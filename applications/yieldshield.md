# YieldShield

## Project Overview

Your savings account is fully insured, you earn a small risk-free yield, and your bank gets rich. What if you could make high DeFi yields risk-free with a decentralized insurance protocol? That's exactly the problem that YieldShield solves. It's a decentralized, highly capital-efficient insurance protocol that uses a tranche-based risk allocation. It serves as the DeFi abstraction layer that makes decentralized finance usable for everyone and will disrupt traditional savings accounts.

The upcoming deployment of the REVM on the Polkadot Hub will help Polkadot to catch-up when it comes to DeFi. However, Polkadot has very few advantages and incentives at this stage for external teams to bring liquidity to Polkadot. We hope to be able to deploy YieldShiel on the hub and this way offer something unique and ultimatily significantly increase the TVL of Polkadot.   

### Project Details

We expect the teams to already have a solid idea about your project's expected final state. Therefore, we ask the teams to submit (where relevant):

- Technology stack: Solidity, Ponder, Next.js 
- Documentation: https://www.yieldshield.dev/docs/overview 
- Mockups/designs of any UI components

### Ecosystem Fit

Help us locate your project in the Polkadot/Kusama landscape and what problems it tries to solve by answering each of these questions:

- Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?


- Who is your target audience (parachain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?
- What need(s) does your project meet?
- How did you identify these needs? Please provide evidence in the form of (scientific) articles, forum discussions, case studies, or raw data.
- Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Polkadot/Kusama ecosystem? Make sure to at least check the [Polkadot Forum](https://forum.polkadot.network/), the [wiki's Tech Stack doc](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/build-open-source) and [OpenGov](https://polkadot.subsquare.io/referenda?status=executed&is_treasury=true).
  - If so, how is your project different? Please identify and assess any projects addressing the same need and explain how your project is distinct. Feel free to include applicable research data, statistics, or metrics.
  - If not, please indicate why such a project might not have been possible, successful, or attempted. 
- Are there any projects similar to yours in related ecosystems?

## Development Status

If you've already started implementing your project or it is part of a larger repository, please provide a link and a description of the code here. In any case, please provide some documentation on the research and other work you have conducted before applying. This could be:

- academic publications relevant to the problem,

- references to conversations you might have had related to this project with relevant actors in the ecosystem,
- previous interface iterations, such as mock-ups and wireframes.

## Development Roadmap

This section should break the development roadmap down into milestones and deliverables. Since these will be part of the agreement, it helps to describe *the functionality we should expect in as much detail as possible*, plus how we can verify and test that functionality. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to this document to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected. Below, we provide an **example milestone** with mandatory (0a to 0e) and example deliverables. 

**Please notice that Polkadot Open Source Grants only accept projects up to 3 months of duration and up to 2 milestones.**

### Overview

- **Estimated Duration:** Duration of the whole project (e.g. 3 months)
- **Full-Time Equivalent (FTE):**  Average number of full-time employees working on the grant throughout its duration (see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-time_equivalent), e.g. 2 FTE)
- **Total Costs:** Requested amount in USD for the whole project (e.g. 12,000 USD).

> Note that deliverables 0a to 0e are mandatory. Please adapt their specification to your project.

| 0c. | Testing and Testing Guide | Core functions will be fully covered by comprehensive unit tests to ensure functionality and robustness. In the guide, we will describe how to run these tests. See the [delivery guidelines](https://github.com/PolkadotOpenSourceGrants/delivery/blob/master/delivery-guidelines.md#testing-guide) for details. |
| 0d. | Docker | We will provide a Dockerfile(s) that can be used to test all the functionality delivered with this milestone. |
| 0e. | Article | We will publish an **article**/workshop that explains [...] (what was done/achieved as part of the grant). (Content, language, and medium should reflect your target audience described above.) |
| 1. | Pallet X | We will create a Substrate module that will... (Please list the functionality that will be implemented for the first milestone. You can refer to details provided in previous sections.) |
| 2. | Smart contract Y | The Y Substrate module will... |
